PARANOIA
========

Album

Lyrics like Beatles
Beats like Kanye

I got a broke clock
Any street murder
Sitting in a corner

separate from the fakes, shakes, makes, nakes

So good I take it from Lao Tzu

11 roses
put some sugar on it
makings of the street

cooks never signed me on
the crew never went on me
girls never put me on
