PARANOIA
========

Album

Lyrics like Beatles
Beats like Kanye

I got a broke clock
Any street murder
Sitting in a corner

separate from the fakes, shakes, makes, nakes

So good I take it from Lao Tzu

11 roses
put some sugar on it
makings of the street

cooks never signed me on
the crew never went on me
girls never put me on

We are war on tour
Going to LH, LA, LB
Going down, going down, I'm in the Park
Queenside, Manhattan, Los Angeles
Be a black thing, green face, knowledge of def, sight of clear
do that, do it, bug out
i learned to build gel docs in my garage
i hack you
i hate you
i slid into place

i bust the rhymes, off to my quest
